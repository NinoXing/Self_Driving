Q:How to try this self driving model?
----
1. You may download the Udacity simulater Version 1 from https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim.<br> 
2. Download drive.py and model.h5 which is a Nvidia model I have already trained.<br> 
3. Before running drive.py, make sure you have all the package need with python3 version.<br> 
4. Run drive.py in the terminal, then open the simulater and choose 800*600 resolution with fastest graphics quality<br>
5. Run Autonomous Mode
   
Q:What if I want to train my own model by creating my own data?
----
1. In the simulator, choose Training Mode.
2. Try to use the arrows on the keyboard to control the vehicle. When you are ready, click RECORD on top right and your driving behaviour will be recorded as data in your PC.
3. Upload your data to your GitHub.
4. Download Behavioural Cloning.ipynb, open it in Google colab, change the dir path to your own GitHub, and don't foget to use GPU when you run the code.
5. Then you have your own model~
